Finance Data analysis in power bi

Connecting Data Sources:
            The first step in this Power BI project is to add raw data from Excel file.

Data transformation: 
   Once the data is connected to Power BI Desktop, the next step is to 
transform the data based on the business requirements. In data transformation, 
we define the relationship between different variables, remove redundancies, add default
values, and create new columns through calculated fields.

Data visualization: 
   The third stage is to convert the transformed data into graphical 
representations. I have using some  beautiful visuals such as Column chart, Bar chart, Daunt chart, Measures, cards, Map
Matrix and Pie chart.

Building the dashboard or reports: 
    The last step in this project is to assemble all 
visualizations on a single interface like tiles.A single page of visualizations is  known
as dashboard. I have create a one simple dashboard. Finally I published and shared with 
other users via the Power BI service.
